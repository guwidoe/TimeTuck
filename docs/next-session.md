# TimeTuck implementation handoff

## Objective and boundaries

Build an independent Rust constraint optimization solver using pinned Timefold
Community tests/public APIs as specifications, with a visual compatibility and
performance dashboard. Objective incomplete; continue closing the remaining compatibility gaps.
Keep pursuing the full objective; this batch is not completion. Never copy or translate
upstream production; Community only, no formal clean-room claim. Upstream pin
remains v2.7.0, `8b815bc6b5f3eb81feedc94dea0885a93b267762`.

Record complete adapted tests/fixtures in `compat/provenance.json`. Partial,
original, skipped or empty tests earn no upstream-method credit. Crates remain
unpublished. Conventional Commits, never amend/rebase/push. The current user direction is to finish integrating completed work, then close
compatibility gaps so the pending backlog shrinks. Keep performance important,
commit occasionally and reuse unchanged verification. Use up to three concurrent GPT-6.1 Sol implementation agents and distribute
builds/tests across available machines. The latest user instruction is to leave
runner-c alone for now; use runner-a and local, with no runner-c probes or wake/auth requests.

## Latest qualification — 296 checked ordinal list registry

`ListProblem::new_ordinal_indexed` offers checked ordinal lookup for Eq+Clone
values without Hash/Ord. Registry entries declare their own stable positions;
queries check bounds and equality. Invalid ordinals return a typed error. Clones
share the index; entity rebuilds preserve the exact function and recompute ranges.
Keys must be pure, stable and equality-consistent. Eq-only defaults and existing
Hash indexing remain. Changed positions use a bounded bitset/table up to 64 values
and a sorted buffer above that boundary, preserving removals and registry order.
The mixed example's explicit `--list-registry-policy ordinal` applies to both
backends and cold reconstruction; Basic registries remain Eq-only. Complete rows,
shadows, full match payloads/scores, pins, search work and budgets remain intact.

Nine original Rust regressions cover non-Hash/arbitrary-order registries, errors,
range/pin atomicity, rebuilds, both storage paths, full source/match/shadow rollback,
real search and pinned cold handoffs. Three Python contracts retain complete
same-graph Eq-only Dense/Stream controls and compare physical calls and unknown
fields. Original graph controls remain. No upstream-method credit is added.

All 16 original workload/profile rows retain four rotating CPU2 forks. Larger
warm Stream improves **11.35%** with component refinement and **10.81%** with
joint search against same-source Eq-only, all four forks in each. Small component
warm Stream is **13.40% slower**; joint larger cold is **3.52% slower**, with mixed
forks. Component larger cold improves 1.02%, also mixed. Dense results vary. Every
full output and actual physical call count matches except time/registry metadata.
No general speed, callback-trace or memory claim follows. Initial tree and sorted
buffer versions were rejected; the latter's actual profile found sorting at 6.82%
self and position discovery at 14.74% inclusive (3,358 samples, zero lost), motivating
the retained bitset. That profile is not of the final bitset artifact.

Final `bash scripts/check.sh`: **8,587 Rust +292 doctests**,
**96 RUN/52 REUSE**, 329.803s; prior build-only precompile used eight
workers with normal four-worker verification environment. Native `5342c37ce8eaf6b7449b4dda42bfc8512110e94b3aaf7685302de07d302fe48c`.
One actual Java mixed refresh: **8/8** at measured time parity, equal
scores in all eight. Larger Stream warm **15.196/16.751 ms Rust/Java**;
cold **14.990/19.594 ms**. Full Eq-only and prior graph observations/samples remain.
Eq-only controls also meet Java parity in this run; cross-run Java ratio changes
do not isolate the native gain. All four fresh Dense medians and both small Stream
medians are slower under ordinals; their controls remain visible. The larger
reference is a feasible certificate, not a proved optimum.
Private and final comparisons use the same actual native artifact; the final
Python-driver input key is recorded separately. Other 17 raw reports retain bytes,
dates and keys; changed relevant inputs remain stale. Native-reference passes and
Java errors never become Java agreement credit.

Dashboard index **85.914%**, **1/18 current**, 17 stale, Java multiplier **1**.
This index measures tracked targets, not remaining effort or an ETA. Inventory
stays 4410/4855, 10 pending, 435 excluded, zero failed/unverified. Actual final
browser evidence covers desktop/mobile and the complete older presentations.
Goal incomplete; previously recorded compatibility gaps remain.
Evidence: work/round296-qualification/{integration,candidate-build-receipt,
final-build-receipt,pair-results,prebuild-receipt,gate-receipt,
mixed-performance-receipt,collection,browser-proof}.json; tree-coalescing-trial/,
sorted-buffer-trial/ and work/parallel-round296-evidence.json.

Next: close remaining relevant compatibility and performance gaps. Preserve all
three graph declarations, both list registry choices and every complete control.
Do not repeat the rejected tree/sorted-buffer trials or resolved behavior audits.
Reuse successful unchanged verification; refresh only deliberately chosen reports.
No new upstream assertions passed in this increment. Initial scope and method
counts remain unchanged; private JVM arrays/history differences are not waived.

The target release example is now the genuinely built final bitset artifact
`357decf5df3bfaac9923c50113c79a3fc4f331aa3214f9857713834640965f23`, native `5342c37ce8eaf6b7449b4dda42bfc8512110e94b3aaf7685302de07d302fe48c`.
The old qualified294 control remains outside target at
`work/round295-qualification/qualified-v2-binary`. The sorted-buffer profile binds
its own rejected source/artifact in `sorted-buffer-trial/`; do not call it a current
profile. Never transplant artifacts or rewrite old source keys. Source restoration
must write bytes or advance mtimes, not preserve old Rust mtimes with copy2.

All builds, focused checks, final verification, native timings, fresh Java and
browser checks in296 ran locally. runner-c remains parked: no probes/wake/auth requests.
runner-a's last bounded connection needed authentication and expired; no remote job
remains live. One existing agent prepared the initial overlay and later performed
a bounded read-only review; no new agent was created. All qualification processes are terminal. The dashboard is localhost8765.

## Remaining limits and retained evidence

- Ten pending upstream methods are eight JVM/loading/framework seams and two
  private k-opt descriptor-array assertions, not ten missing native algorithms.
  Original methods/denominators stay visible; no reclassification for credit.
- Connected-range agreement remains 66/197 under the explicit wrapping metric;
  native/reference checks pass all 197. The 131 differences include Java history
  bugs. `compat/observations/connected-range-history.json` retains the contradictory
  histories; the user policy question remains unanswered. Do not infer a waiver.
- List metadata retains 425/514 agreements: 16 differences, 40 Java errors and
  33 unsupported empty cases. Prior public probes found no justified native fix;
  retain their complete observations rather than repeating the same audit.
- Cyclic-supplier checks retain 107/128 agreements and 21 actual Java errors.
  Native-reference passes never count Java failures as successful agreement.
- Great Deluge292 retains its original evidence (see live freshness): explicit binary64 276/276, 25/25 prefixes
  and 184/184 additional probes; exact default stays 275/276.
  Encounter-order ranking has 4824/4824 agreements; total-order controls retain
  4499 agreements/325 differences. Load-balance binary64/wrapping policy has
  101/101 last-observed agreements, exact-root control 100 and default 97; it is
  stale now. Do not repeat unchanged successful investigations for a new turn.
- Mixed296 is current, **8/8** at measured Java parity and equal quality in all eight. Larger Stream warm 15.196/16.751 ms Rust/Java, cold 14.990/19.594 ms. Full same-graph Eq-only Dense/Stream and ordinary/v1 graph controls remain. No general/equal-work/memory claim.
- Source restoration must write bytes or advance mtime; never copy old Rust
  source mtimes or target fingerprints/binaries into a supposed new build.
  Verify actual compiler artifacts before performance comparisons.


Use docs/completion.md, docs/compatibility.md and native contracts for current scope,
requirements and original evidence. Goal remains active and incomplete.
