# TimeTuck implementation handoff

## Objective and boundaries

Build an independent Rust constraint optimization solver using pinned Timefold
Community tests/public APIs as specifications, with a visual compatibility and
performance dashboard. Objective incomplete; continue closing the remaining compatibility gaps.
Keep pursuing the full objective; this batch is not completion. Never copy or translate
upstream production; Community only, no formal clean-room claim. Upstream pin
remains v2.7.0, `8b815bc6b5f3eb81feedc94dea0885a93b267762`.

Record complete adapted tests/fixtures in `compat/provenance.json`. Partial,
original, skipped or empty tests earn no upstream-method credit. Crates remain
unpublished. Conventional Commits, never amend/rebase/push. The current user direction is to finish integrating completed work, then close
compatibility gaps so the pending backlog shrinks. Keep performance important,
commit occasionally and reuse unchanged verification. Use up to three concurrent GPT-6.1 Sol implementation agents and distribute
builds/tests across available machines. The user has re-enabled runner-c; use local, runner-a and runner-c for
independent build/test work. Preserve live runs across observation timeouts.

## Current state — 304 source qualification and policy decisions

Native source is unchanged from qualified 303:
`91293273b471934d676f56b677e5fe18db01a29af86f1ec37f724ae5868fb941`. Reuse **8,600 Rust tests +292 doctests** and the
successful source-bound gate; no repeated broad gate or browser suite this batch.

All **18/18 reports are current**. Four complete differential jobs ran locally;
thirteen complete performance jobs ran on runner-a with both runtimes on its CPU.
Repair's already current 303 report retains its exact bytes/date/key. All original
settings, fixtures, full native controls, sampled outputs and quality criteria
remain. No reduced cases, new credits, exclusions or relabeled older results.

**108/109 timed workloads meet the target; 13/14 complete performance sections.**
The sole current miss is warm `mixed-clustered-pins · stream`: **12.931825 ms Rust
/11.849886 ms Java**, ratio 1.091304, equal score `[0,-338]`. Other seven mixed
rows meet the target. This is a new same-CPU measurement, not a controlled
cross-run native regression claim. The next implementation target is this case;
do not re-audit resolved range/list/JVM seams or blindly refresh all reports again.

The actual measured mixed artifact is saved outside Cargo target:
`work/round304-qualification/baseline-mixed_solver_benchmark`, SHA256
`f1a2bfa29c575abb33e3f312809625f124efddc5b51f11558ab4099b37f3a2d8`.
`mixed-baseline-artifact.json` binds it to runner-a's actual measurement/source.
Use the existing original row/config/control outputs to profile/compare it;
genuinely build changes, never transplant target artifacts/fingerprints or mtimes.
runner-a queue and all local jobs are terminal. runner-c remains offline; its 303 worker
outcome remains unresolved, preserve that snapshot and do not restart blindly.

User explicitly chose **consistent native range behavior** and **stable native
list capture/rollback**, instead of Java's history flags/post-move getter behavior.
Both approvals are recorded in compat/observations/. Strict agreements remain
range 66/197 with 197 native passes; list metadata 425/514 with 514 native passes,
16 differences, 40 Java errors, 33 unsupported; cyclic 107/128 and 21 Java errors.
Native/reference success never becomes Java agreement. Preserve all raw cases.

Dashboard strict measured index **95.541%**, source inventory
4410/4855, 10 pending, 435 excluded, zero failed/unverified. This index is not effort,
ETA or native completion. The ten pending remain eight JVM/API seams plus two private kopt
array assertions; native physical kopt exists. A read-only scope trace found no
new missing native algorithm. Goal remains incomplete: current timing target
still misses one workload and final native readiness must stay distinct from the
strict original comparison index. Design only for that future model supplement:
work/round304-completion-model-design.md; both user policy approvals arrived
subsequently. Do not turn accepted policies/errors into agreement passes.

Evidence: compat/observations/current-source-qualification.json,
work/round304-qualification/ and work/parallel-round304-evidence.json.

## Previous implementation — 299 coalesced checked-sum replacements

SumCollector defers one logical primitive replacement. Checked chains compose;
inverses cancel. Each public operation still checks its own signed difference,
total and current membership before any change. Other successful mutations
materialize the pending frequency edit. Logical equality ignores representation;
clones retain the complete pending state and shared roots. Duplicate/zero captures,
checked overflow, Send/Sync, no-pending removal and graph rollback remain intact.
Five original regressions supplement all seven existing checked-sum regressions;
no upstream-method credit is added.

Against the actual qualified 296 artifact, original sum update/restore workloads
improve **87.65% / 91.26%** at 64/512 captures,
every four-fork comparison faster. All 96 original full validation cases and all 6
original timing inputs/settings/outputs remain. Separate public-API controls retain
full frequency reconstruction and drains: inverse and connected-chain paths
improve every fork, while alternating independent captures have **1.24% /
6.23% higher medians**, mixed forks. Unchanged set/map controls retain
2–5.5% higher pooled medians with mixed forks. Deferred work can move onto unrelated
edits or equality; the collector grows by one bounded field. No general speed,
whole-solver, memory or Java execution-work equivalence claim follows.

One final `bash scripts/check.sh`: **8,592 Rust +292 doctests**,
**95 RUN/53 REUSE**, 337.394s; build-only precompile
uses eight workers and the standard gate retains its normal four-worker environment.
Native `5c53146bd6f7704b324616f13f2bfe87772277ba4abe1941cca64f090f6cb827`. One actual Java aggregate refresh retains all 96 checks and
all 6 original workloads; **6/6 meet measured time parity**, with full checked
trial/restore/commit observations and checksums. Other 17 raw reports retain bytes,
dates and actual keys. Mixed296 becomes stale under the shared input change;
its earlier 8/8 result is historical, not refreshed here. Dashboard UI/data contract
is unchanged: reuse actual 296 desktop/mobile proof and check current HTTP report,
source/model hashes and freshness. No repeated browser suite or unchanged Rust gate.

Dashboard index **86.124%**, **1/18 current**, 17 stale, Java multiplier **1**.
This is a tracked-target index, not remaining effort or an ETA. Inventory remains
4410/4855 (90.834%), 10 pending, 435 excluded, zero failed/unverified. Remaining behavior
gaps are not waived; goal active/incomplete. The 297 profile on qualified 296 found
Arc::make_mut at 67.32% self (2,038 samples, zero lost), motivating deferred edits. The 298 cardinality prototype was rejected; its changes are
absent. Evidence: work/round297-aggregate-gap/, work/round298-qualification/;
work/round299-qualification/{integration,candidate-build-receipt,pair-results,
control-pair-results,gate-receipt,aggregate-performance-receipt,collection}.json.

Current aggregate release artifact `d641790ff61042938ef558c56f7d29a69ab501523c6e6abc0185f161d09b6659` is actually built
from the native source above. The mixed296 artifact remains historical. Next:
use this qualified baseline, close another relevant behavior/performance gap,
and reuse unchanged successful checks. No new agent was created; one existing
agent prepared the overlays. All qualification ran locally. runner-a SSH now works; its Rust 1.92 toolchain
is in `/home/developer/.cache/timetuck-build/rust-1.92.0/bin` (prepend to PATH).
No remote build/auth job is live. runner-c remains parked. The dashboard is localhost8765.

## Previous qualification — 296 checked ordinal list registry

`ListProblem::new_ordinal_indexed` offers checked ordinal lookup for Eq+Clone
values without Hash/Ord. Registry entries declare their own stable positions;
queries check bounds and equality. Invalid ordinals return a typed error. Clones
share the index; entity rebuilds preserve the exact function and recompute ranges.
Keys must be pure, stable and equality-consistent. Eq-only defaults and existing
Hash indexing remain. Changed positions use a bounded bitset/table up to 64 values
and a sorted buffer above that boundary, preserving removals and registry order.
The mixed example's explicit `--list-registry-policy ordinal` applies to both
backends and cold reconstruction; Basic registries remain Eq-only. Complete rows,
shadows, full match payloads/scores, pins, search work and budgets remain intact.

Nine original Rust regressions cover non-Hash/arbitrary-order registries, errors,
range/pin atomicity, rebuilds, both storage paths, full source/match/shadow rollback,
real search and pinned cold handoffs. Three Python contracts retain complete
same-graph Eq-only Dense/Stream controls and compare physical calls and unknown
fields. Original graph controls remain. No upstream-method credit is added.

All 16 original workload/profile rows retain four rotating CPU2 forks. Larger
warm Stream improves **11.35%** with component refinement and **10.81%** with
joint search against same-source Eq-only, all four forks in each. Small component
warm Stream is **13.40% slower**; joint larger cold is **3.52% slower**, with mixed
forks. Component larger cold improves 1.02%, also mixed. Dense results vary. Every
full output and actual physical call count matches except time/registry metadata.
No general speed, callback-trace or memory claim follows. Initial tree and sorted
buffer versions were rejected; the latter's actual profile found sorting at 6.82%
self and position discovery at 14.74% inclusive (3,358 samples, zero lost), motivating
the retained bitset. That profile is not of the final bitset artifact.

Final `bash scripts/check.sh`: **8,587 Rust +292 doctests**,
**96 RUN/52 REUSE**, 329.803s; prior build-only precompile used eight
workers with normal four-worker verification environment. Native `5342c37ce8eaf6b7449b4dda42bfc8512110e94b3aaf7685302de07d302fe48c`.
One actual Java mixed refresh: **8/8** at measured time parity, equal
scores in all eight. Larger Stream warm **15.196/16.751 ms Rust/Java**;
cold **14.990/19.594 ms**. Full Eq-only and prior graph observations/samples remain.
Eq-only controls also meet Java parity in this run; cross-run Java ratio changes
do not isolate the native gain. All four fresh Dense medians and both small Stream
medians are slower under ordinals; their controls remain visible. The larger
reference is a feasible certificate, not a proved optimum.
Private and final comparisons use the same actual native artifact; the final
Python-driver input key is recorded separately. Other 17 raw reports retain bytes,
dates and keys; changed relevant inputs remain stale. Native-reference passes and
Java errors never become Java agreement credit.

Dashboard index **85.914%**, **1/18 current**, 17 stale, Java multiplier **1**.
This index measures tracked targets, not remaining effort or an ETA. Inventory
stays 4410/4855, 10 pending, 435 excluded, zero failed/unverified. Actual final
browser evidence covers desktop/mobile and the complete older presentations.
Goal incomplete; previously recorded compatibility gaps remain.
Evidence: work/round296-qualification/{integration,candidate-build-receipt,
final-build-receipt,pair-results,prebuild-receipt,gate-receipt,
mixed-performance-receipt,collection,browser-proof}.json; tree-coalescing-trial/,
sorted-buffer-trial/ and work/parallel-round296-evidence.json.

Next: close remaining relevant compatibility and performance gaps. Preserve all
three graph declarations, both list registry choices and every complete control.
Do not repeat the rejected tree/sorted-buffer trials or resolved behavior audits.
Reuse successful unchanged verification; refresh only deliberately chosen reports.
No new upstream assertions passed in this increment. Initial scope and method
counts remain unchanged; private JVM arrays/history differences are not waived.

The target release example is now the genuinely built final bitset artifact
`357decf5df3bfaac9923c50113c79a3fc4f331aa3214f9857713834640965f23`, native `5342c37ce8eaf6b7449b4dda42bfc8512110e94b3aaf7685302de07d302fe48c`.
The old qualified294 control remains outside target at
`work/round295-qualification/qualified-v2-binary`. The sorted-buffer profile binds
its own rejected source/artifact in `sorted-buffer-trial/`; do not call it a current
profile. Never transplant artifacts or rewrite old source keys. Source restoration
must write bytes or advance mtimes, not preserve old Rust mtimes with copy2.

All builds, focused checks, final verification, native timings, fresh Java and
browser checks in296 ran locally. runner-c remains parked: no probes/wake/auth requests.
runner-a's last bounded connection needed authentication and expired; no remote job
remains live. One existing agent prepared the initial overlay and later performed
a bounded read-only review; no new agent was created. All qualification processes are terminal. The dashboard is localhost8765.

## Remaining limits and retained evidence

- Ten pending upstream methods remain eight JVM/loading/framework seams and two
  exact private k-opt descriptor-array assertions. Original identities and counts
  stay visible; native physical k-opt execution does not make private arrays pass.
- Connected ranges remain 66/197 Java agreement and 197 native-reference passes.
  The user accepted consistent native behavior; history witnesses remain in
  compat/observations/connected-range-history.json. This adds no Java passes.
- List metadata remains 425/514 agreements, 16 differing sets, 40 Java errors and
  33 unsupported empty compositions. The user accepted stable native capture and
  rollback. See compat/observations/list-metadata-policy.json; no repeated audit
  or reproduction of stale-coordinate getter failures is required.
- Cyclic suppliers retain 107/128 agreements and 21 actual Java runtime errors.
  Native independent reachability/recovery proof is separate; errors earn no
  agreement credit. All current reports retain the complete unavailable cohort.
- Current 304 solver comparisons retain binary64 Great Deluge 276/276, 25/25
  prefixes and 184/184 additional probes, with exact-default 275/276. Encounter
  ranking retains 4824/4824 and total-order controls 4499 agreements/325 differences.
  Current load-balance selected policy is 101/101; exact-root control 100, default 97.
  Do not repeat successful unchanged investigations for a new turn.
- Current mixed performance is 7/8 at Java parity. Larger warm Stream is the sole
  remaining measured timing miss; use its actual artifact and original controls
  identified above. Larger optimum and identical Java search traces are not proved.
- Restore source with fresh mtimes. Never transplant Cargo fingerprints/artifacts
  or rewrite old measurement keys to claim a new build/qualification.

Use docs/completion.md, docs/compatibility.md and native contracts for scope and
original evidence. Goal remains active and incomplete.
