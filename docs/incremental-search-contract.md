# Incremental scoring and local search

The native implementation now provides a static scoped constraint network,
transactional score caching, lazy basic-variable neighborhoods, and bounded local
search. It is not a constraint-stream implementation or complete Timefold solver.

## Scoped constraints

`ConstraintNetwork<V, S>` declares the model's variable count. Each named
constraint has an ordered list of variable indices and a deterministic callback
receiving only those variables as `Option<&V>`. Repeated scope indices are passed
through to the callback. An empty scope is a constant contribution. Duplicate
names and out-of-range indices are rejected before registration.

The network sums ordinary score components using `AdditiveScore`. The built-in
integer scores use modular arithmetic, as documented in `score-contract.md`.
Constraint contributions must have structural zero. The network sets structural
state to minus the number of unassigned required variables; optional `None` values
are complete choices. This is the native model's incompleteness convention, not a
claim that every Timefold structural-validation behavior has been implemented.
Callbacks must handle partial assignments when their scoring session permits them.
Captured facts and value identity must remain immutable during a session.

`ScoreDirector` owns its assignment and contribution cache and borrows the model
and network. A candidate move uses the existing reversible assignment transaction.
Touched variables identify dependent constraints; each is reevaluated once even
when a composite writes a variable repeatedly or a scope repeats an index.
Untouched contributions remain cached. Domain/pin errors and scoring errors reject
the move. Ordinary unwinding also restores the assignment.

`ScoredMove` exposes a read-only candidate assignment and score. Its cache updates
are deferred: dropping it rejects the move without changing any cache entry;
`commit()` keeps both values and score updates. Existing drop-guard limitations
(abort, forgetting the guard, panicking value destructors) still apply. An external
fact mutated through interior mutability cannot be rolled back by this transaction.
`assert_consistent()` recalculates every contribution as well as the total, detecting
corruption even when two wrong contributions cancel. Diagnostic recomputation is
optional during search.

Only constraint callbacks are incremental in this first implementation. Model
validation and structural counting still scan variables; callbacks allocate small
argument vectors, and affected-constraint indices are sorted/deduplicated. No
constant-time move update or broad runtime-speedup claim is made.

## Neighborhoods and search

`change_moves` emits domain values in declared order, excluding the current value
and pinned variables, and emits `None` last for optional variables. `swap_moves`
emits ordered pairs, including both `(a,b)` and `(b,a)`, but skips pins, equal
values and incompatible target domains. Unassigned values may only move into
optional variables. Both iterators validate their starting assignment and generate
moves lazily without collecting a neighborhood-sized list.

`local_search` starts with existing initial values and pins. It fills each required
unassigned variable with its first domain value; optional `None` is retained. This
is first-fit initialization, not a score-aware construction heuristic.

Search scans changes, optionally followed by swaps, and commits the first accepted
candidate before restarting its scan. Default strict improvement accepts only
better scores. `Acceptance::HillClimbing` also accepts ties, matching the adapted
upstream acceptance assertions; plateaus may cycle, so limits remain essential.
Neither policy currently accepts worsening moves. There is no randomized order,
late acceptance, tabu, annealing, or parallel search in this increment.

Configuration requires finite evaluation and accepted-move limits (defaults are
10,000 and 1,000). The initial score counts as one evaluation; each considered move
counts once. A zero evaluation budget never invokes a scoring callback. Optional
assertion-mode recomputations are excluded from budgets and callback statistics.
At a step boundary the accepted-move limit takes precedence. Otherwise the
iterator checks for a next move before applying the evaluation cap: exhausting the
last rejected move exactly at the budget reports `NoAcceptedMove`.

Results retain the earliest best complete assignment. A hard-infeasible best is
still returned honestly. Termination distinguishes evaluation limit, accepted-move
limit, empty complete space, and a neighborhood with no accepted move. None is a
proof of global optimality. Tests include a local trap with a strictly better global
optimum to enforce that distinction.

## Evidence and limits

Nine additional fully adapted upstream methods cover provider behavior and the
hill-climbing acceptance rule. All source methods, fixture initial states and
modifications are recorded in `compat/provenance.json`. Original tests cover
2,000 seeded change/swap sequences against an independent full-score formula,
error/panic rollback, per-constraint cache checks, modular overflow, pins/optional
ranges, plateau limits, known separable optima, swap-only improvements and generated
graph solutions checked against independent optima and every local neighbor.

Run the original larger example with:

```sh
cargo run --release --example graph_coloring
```

It solves 100 variables with four colors and 400 scoped constraints. The current
deterministic configuration finds `0hard/0soft` after 33,268 score evaluations and
227 accepted moves. It invokes 233,269 constraint callbacks; full rescoring of
those evaluations would invoke 13,307,200. This is a callback-count comparison,
not a Java comparison or measured runtime speedup. The existing dashboard benchmarks
still cover score operations and two small exhaustive problems only.
