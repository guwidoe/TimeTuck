# Native constraint streams

`ConstraintStream<T>` is an eager, typed multiset relation. Rows may be facts,
stable IDs, references or tuples; ordinary Rust equality defines their identity.
Use explicit IDs to distinguish objects with otherwise equal attributes.
The library receives exactly the supplied rows. Callers explicitly filter
unassigned planning variables; there is no implicit Java-style fact discovery.

The current implementation operates on snapshots. Put a stream pipeline in a
`ConstraintNetwork` or `ListConstraintNetwork` callback with the complete variable
scope on which it depends. Affected callbacks rebuild their stream; unrelated
callbacks retain their cached contributions. This is scoped incremental scoring,
not an incremental tuple graph. Row insertion/update/retraction propagation,
shared graph nodes and cached join/group indexes are still pending.

## Relations and scoring

- Filter, map, flat-map and concat preserve duplicate occurrences and encounter
  order. Distinct retains the first occurrence of each equal row.
- Predicate joins scan all pairs. Equality joins index the right-hand rows by
  hash key, preserving left order and then right order within each match. Tuple
  keys support multiple equalities. Self matches and duplicate cross products
  are intentional. Additional range predicates can filter the resulting pairs.
- Exists/not-exists retain or reject each left occurrence without multiplying it
  by the number of right matches. They scan right rows until the outcome is known.
  Excluding the same entity requires a stable-ID predicate supplied by the caller.
- Unique pairs emit each pair of distinct input positions once (`i < j`). Equal
  values at different positions still pair; this is not planning-ID sorting.
- Group-by produces one `(key, rows)` per observed key in first-occurrence order.
  Group-collect produces integer summaries in the same key order. Empty input
  creates no keyed group; collecting the entire empty relation yields zeros and
  absent extrema. Key/value mappings run once per input row in encounter order.
- Score evaluates one ordinary contribution per row and adds it with the selected
  score type's arithmetic. Negative contributions penalize, positive ones reward.
  The empty score is zero. Nonzero structural contributions return an error with
  the offending row index before arithmetic can discard them. Structural state
  remains the planning model's responsibility. Rows themselves provide the match
  tuples; named justifications/indictments are not yet implemented.

Streams own their row storage. Borrowed facts must remain valid and callbacks must
be deterministic throughout a scoring session. Interior mutation of captured
facts can invalidate cached contributions, just as for existing score callbacks.
Encounter order does not depend on hash iteration order. Joins materialize their
outputs; a Cartesian join has quadratic output size. No memory or throughput
parity with Timefold's incremental engine is claimed.

## Retractable integer collectors

`IntCollector` captures integer values and multiplicities in an ordered multiset.
Insert adds one occurrence; remove retracts one and reports whether it existed.
An absent removal is a no-op. The summary includes native `usize` occurrence and
distinct counts, wrapping signed 64-bit sum, and optional minimum/maximum. Empty
results have zero counts/sum and `None` extrema. Count overflow panics before any
state modification. Inserts/removals cost logarithmic time in distinct values.

Unlike a closure capturing a mutable domain object, removal takes its previously
inserted integer. To update a mapped fact, remove its old mapped value and insert
its new value. The caller tracks that old value; collector tokens and mutable
object listeners are not provided. Independent equal occurrences are
indistinguishable, and each removal consumes only one of them.

## Evidence and limitations

Five adapted methods from pinned `InnerUniConstraintCollectorsTest` preserve all
seven assertions each, including duplicate insertion/retraction and empty
results. Exact provenance and native representation changes are recorded in
`compat/provenance.json`. This grants five upstream collector-method passes.
It grants no passes for upstream stream graph, descriptor, notification or
constraint-match explanation tests.

Twelve original regression methods additionally check:

- 4,096 seeded collector edits against independently rebuilt multiset summaries,
  including signed integer boundaries, overflow and absent removals.
- 256 indexed-join cases against nested enumeration, with deliberate hash
  collisions, duplicates and empty sides, plus chained joins and tuple keys.
- Bag semantics, grouping order, existence multiplicity, empty groups, distinct
  values, structural rejection and weighted multilevel scores.
- All 81 partial assignments of a four-job/two-machine scheduling problem against
  independent loops, plus every composite move's rollback and commit.
- Exact enumeration of all 16 complete assignments, greedy construction and
  local improvement from an overloaded assignment to independently checked
  `0hard/0soft`. All constraints are nonpositive, so zero is also an upper bound.

The existing Java/Rust comparison and benchmark sections cover earlier score,
move, exact and heuristic workloads. They do not measure these stream operations.
Public-API Java stream comparisons and matched stream timing are future work.
